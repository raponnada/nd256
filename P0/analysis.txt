TASK-0 
Worst case Big O efficieny: O(1)
1. reading first record of texts is O(1), because by reading one line we can tell that first record is available or not. 

Worst case Big O efficieny: O(1)
reading any record from a list takes constant time i.e, O(1).


TASK-1 
Worst case Big O efficieny: O(n)
n - total number of call and text records
for each and every phone number we add it to the set.

TASK-2
Worst case Big O efficieny: O(n)
n - number of call records
every record has to be checked to determine which phone number has longest time duration.

TASK-3
Worst case Big O efficieny: O(n log n)

n - number of call/text records

We have to go through each and every record to collect unique area codes set. 
If unique area codes set is in reverse lexicographic order, than worst case sorting complexity is O(m log m)


TASK-4
Worst case Big O efficieny: O(n log n)

n - number of call/text records

We have to go through each and every call and text record to collect unique phone numbers.
If telemarketers set is in reverse lexicographic order, than worst case sorting complexity is O(k log k)
